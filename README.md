# Data-Analysis---Titanic
This project is part of the "Learning Python for Data Analysis" course I enrolled in.

The purpose of this project was to answer the following 4 questions:
  1.) Who were the passengers on the Titanic? (Ages,Gender,Class,..etc)
  2.) What deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class?
  3.) Where did the passengers come from?
  4.) Who was alone and who was with family?
  
At the end of the project, I was challenged to answer 2 more questions:
  5.) Did the deck have an effect on the passengers survival rate?
  6.) Did having a family member increase the odds of surviving the crash?

I used different approaches in order to make it as personal as possible.
Go ahead and take a look!
